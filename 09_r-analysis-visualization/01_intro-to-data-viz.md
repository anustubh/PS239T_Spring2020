# Intro to Data Analysis 

## Why visualize data? 

There are two major reasons we want to visualize our data:
* Exploratory data analysis (getting to know our own data)
* Story-telling (helping others get to know our data)

Using graphics to explore your own data is a best practice
* In quantitative analysis, focus on statistical significance can blind us to
the real findings, and can cause inadvertent “p-hacking”
* In qualitative analysis, the huge scope of the data (and often inductive
nature of the research) can lead to a similar phenomenon: “cherrypicking”
of particular quotations or events that support one’s arguments

## Challenge: Compare plots

In 2019, Steph Curry was asked to rank the popcorn in every NBA arena. Look at the many ways that this data has been visualized. Then discuss what version you like best and why. 

Let's first take a look at the heatmap approach that the NYT used: [link](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/12/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-popcorn.html).

Doing a google image search for "steph curry popcorn rankings" reveals many attempts to re-visualize this dataset. 

For example...
