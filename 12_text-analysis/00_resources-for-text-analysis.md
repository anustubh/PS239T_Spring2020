# Resources for Text Analysis

## Cheatsheets (R) 

These cheatsheets are useful for manipulating text data:
* [Regular expressions](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/regex.pdf).
* [Manipulating strings with stringr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf).
* Manage and analyze text data using the [quanteda package](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/quanteda.pdf)

If you are doing machine learning or using big data, check out the following: 
* For important and manipulating large datasets, see [Data transformation with data.table](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/datatable.pdf).
* For information about parallel computing in R, see [Parallel Computing](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/parallel_computation.pdf).
* Machine learning in R using [mlr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/mlr.pdf)
* Deep learning in R using [keras](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/keras.pdf)
